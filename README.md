This is a visual aid that displays musical modes, and optionally major chords or 7ths. It can be run standalone, or as a VST plugin. It does not affect audio or MIDI.
It is based on a physical device invented by Diego Merino, and replicates that functionality in software form.

• Click on any note to move it on the top center 

• Choose any of these modes:  
	&emsp;&emsp;Ionian (Major)  
	&emsp;&emsp;Dorian  
	&emsp;&emsp;Phrygian  
	&emsp;&emsp;Lydian  
	&emsp;&emsp;Mixolydian  
	&emsp;&emsp;Eolian (Natural minor)  
	&emsp;&emsp;Locrian  
	&emsp;&emsp;Harmonic minor  
	&emsp;&emsp;Melodic minor  
  
• Display:  
	&emsp;&emsp;Only notes  
	&emsp;&emsp;Notes + Major chords  
	&emsp;&emsp;Notes + 7th chords  
  
• Choose between CDE or DoReMi notation.  
  
• Ligth and Dark modes.  
  
• Full circle or Half circle mode, for saving screen space.  

• You can also use the keyboard arrows:  
	&emsp;&emsp;Left / Right 		turns the circle.  
	&emsp;&emsp;Up / Down 		changes mode  
	&emsp;&emsp;Shift Up / Down		toggles between Only notes / Major chords / 7th chords.
